# Advaita - The Everything Editor

Advaita is a playground where I let my imagination run wild. At the heart of the idea is the beauty of an infinite canvas and how it should be used to be default experience for editing anything. Collaboration first, the perfect playground for realizing your next creative project. You are viewing rewrite (#2), many more to come :wink:
